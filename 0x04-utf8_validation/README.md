Universal Transformation Format - 8-bit(UTF-8) is a variable length character encoding standard used for communication. It's a 1 to 4 byte encoding system (though special cases like national flag encoding have 8-bytes) used to represent over 100,000+ characters eliminating the incompatibilities bugging different encodings.
It uses one byte to represent all ASCII characters with a leading 0 to ensure that older 7-bit computers are carried along. So all ASCII values are utf-8 but utf-8 allows for diatrics, maths symbols, and emojis including most characters of different languages.
UTF-8 can accommodate 256 characters, 2**8 a minimum of `00000000` and a max value of `11111111`. In this project, we will use the min and max values for both positive and negative integers to check if a number passed is a valid utf-8 integer
